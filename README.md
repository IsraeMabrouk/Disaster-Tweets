# Disaster-Tweets
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at classifying tweets related to disasters. The project focuses on leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to distinguish between tweets that contain information about real-world disasters and those that do not.


# Features
- **Data Collection:** Utilized a diverse dataset of tweets from Kaggle, encompassing different types of disasters. The Kaggle dataset serves as a comprehensive and reliable source, providing a rich variety of real-world scenarios for training and evaluating the disaster tweets classification model.
-**Preprocessing:** Implemented robust text preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the text data for model training.
- **Model Training:** Developed and trained a machine learning model using state-of-the-art NLP libraries and algorithms to accurately classify disaster-related tweets.
- **Evaluation:** Conducted comprehensive evaluations on the model's performance, including metrics such as accuracy and precision.
